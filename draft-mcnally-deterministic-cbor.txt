                       dCBOR: Deterministic CBOR
                draft-mcnally-deterministic-cbor-latest

Abstract

   The purpose of determinism is to ensure that semantically equivalent
   data items are encoded into identical byte streams.  CBOR (RFC 8949)
   defines "Deterministically Encoded CBOR" in its Section 4.2, but
   leaves some important choices up to the application developer.  The
   present document specifies dCBOR, a set of narrowing rules for CBOR
   that can be used to help achieve interoperable deterministic encoding
   for a variety of applications desiring a narrow and clearly defined
   set of choices.

1.  Introduction

   CBOR [RFC8949] has many advantages over other data serialization
   formats.  One of its strengths is specifications and guidelines for
   serializing data deterministically, such that multiple agents
   serializing the same data automatically achieve consensus on the
   exact byte-level form of that serialized data.  This is particularly
   useful when data must be compared for semantic equivalence by
   comparing the hash of its contents.

   Nonetheless, determinism is an opt-in feature of CBOR, and most
   existing CBOR codecs put the primary burden of correct deterministic
   serialization and validation of deterministic encoding during
   deserialization on the engineer.  Furthermore, the specification
   leaves a number of important decisions around determinism up to the
   application developer.

   This document narrows CBOR to a set of requirements called "dCBOR".
   These requirements include choices left open in CBOR, but also go
   beyond, including requiring that dCBOR decoders validate that encoded
   CBOR conforms to the requirements of this document.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Narrowing Rules

   This section specifies the exclusions and reductions that dCBOR
   applies to CBOR.

   The rules specified here do not "fork" CBOR: A dCBOR implementation
   produces well-formed, deterministically encoded CBOR according to
   [RFC8949], and existing CBOR decoders will therefore be able to
   decode it.  Similarly, CBOR encoders will be able to produce valid
   dCBOR if handed dCBOR-conforming data model level information from an
   application.

   Note that the separation between standard CBOR processing and the
   processing required by the dCBOR rules is a conceptual one: Both
   dCBOR processing and standard CBOR processing may be combined into a
   unified dCBOR/CBOR codec.  The requirements in this document apply to
   encoding or decoding of dCBOR data, regardless of whether the codec
   is a unified dCBOR/CBOR codec operating in dCBOR-compliant modes, or
   a single-purpose dCBOR codec.  Both of these are generically referred
   to as "dCBOR codecs" in this document.

   dCBOR is intended to be used in conjunction with an application,
   which typically will use a subset of CBOR, which in turn influences
   which subset of dCBOR that is used.  As a result, dCBOR places no
   direct requirement on what subset of CBOR is implemented.  For
   instance, there is no requirement that dCBOR implementations support
   floating point numbers (or any other kind of non-basic integer type,
   such as arbitrary precision integers or complex numbers) when they
   are used with applications that do not use them.  However, this
   document does place requirements on dCBOR implementations that
   support negative 64-bit integers and 64-bit or smaller floating point
   numbers.

2.1.  Definite Length Items

   CBOR [RFC8949] allows both "definite-length" and "indefinite-length"
   items for byte strings, text strings, arrays, and maps (§3.2).

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST only emit "definite-length" items for byte strings, text
       strings, arrays, and maps.

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST reject any encoded "indefinite-length" items for byte
       strings, text strings, arrays, and maps.

2.2.  Preferred Serialization

   CBOR [RFC8949] allows multiple possible encodings for the same data
   item, and defines a "preferred serialization" in §4.1 to be used for
   deterministic encoding.

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST only emit "preferred serialization".

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST validate that encoded CBOR conforms to "preferred
       serialization", and reject any encoded CBOR that does not
       conform.

2.3.  Ordered Map Keys

   The last bullet item of CBOR [RFC8949] §4.2.1 defines a "bytewise
   lexicographic order" for map keys to be used for deterministic
   encoding.

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST only emit CBOR maps with keys in "bytewise lexicographic
       order".

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST validate that encoded CBOR maps have keys in "bytewise
       lexicographic order", and reject any encoded maps that do not
       conform.

2.4.  Duplicate Map Keys

   CBOR [RFC8949] defines maps with duplicate keys as invalid, but
   leaves how to handle such cases to the implementor (§2.2, §3.1, §5.4,
   §5.6).

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST NOT emit CBOR maps that contain duplicate keys.

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST reject encoded maps with duplicate keys.

2.5.  Numeric Reduction

   The purpose of determinism is to ensure that semantically equivalent
   data items are encoded into identical byte streams.  Numeric
   Reduction ensures that semantically equal numeric values (e.g. 2 and
   2.0) are encoded into identical byte streams (e.g. 0x02) by encoding
   "Integral floating point values" (floating point values with a zero
   fractional part) as integers when possible.

   dCBOR implementations that support floating point numbers:

   1.  MUST check whether floating point values to be encoded have the
       numerically equal value in DCBOR_INT = [-2^63, 2^64-1].  If that
       is the case, it MUST be converted to that numerically equal
       integer value before encoding it.  (Preferred encoding will then
       ensure the shortest length encoding is used.)  If a floating
       point value has a non-zero fractional part, or an exponent that
       takes it out of DCBOR_INT, the original floating point value is
       used for encoding.  (Specifically, conversion to a CBOR bignum is
       never considered.)

       This also means that the three representations of a zero number
       in CBOR (0, 0.0, -0.0 in diagnostic notation) are all reduced to
       the basic integer 0 (with preferred encoding 0x00).

      |  Note that Numeric Reduction means that some maps that are valid
      |  CBOR cannot be reduced to valid dCBOR maps, as Numeric
      |  Reduction can result in multiple entries with the same keys
      |  ("duplicate keys").  For example, the following is a valid CBOR
      |  map:
      |  
      |     {
      |        10: "ten",
      |        10.0: "floating ten"
      |     }
      |  
      |         Figure 1: Valid CBOR data item with numeric map keys
      |  
      |  Applying Numeric Reduction to this map would yield the invalid
      |  map:
      |  
      |     {  / invalid: multiple entries with the same key /
      |        10: "ten",
      |        10: "floating ten"
      |     }
      |  
      |         Figure 2: Numeric Reduction turns valid CBOR invalid
      |  
      |  In general, dCBOR applications need to avoid maps that have
      |  entries with keys that are semantically equivalent in dCBOR's
      |  numeric model.

   2.  MUST reduce all encoded NaN values to the quiet NaN value having
       the half-width CBOR representation 0xf97e00.

   dCBOR decoders that support floating point numbers:

   3.  MUST reject any encoded floating point values that are not
       encoded according to the above rules.

2.6.  Simple Values

   Only the three "simple" (major type 7) values false (0xf4), true
   (0xf5), and null (0xf6) and the floating point values are valid in
   dCBOR.

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST NOT encode major type 7 values other than false, true, null,
       and the floating point values.

   dCBOR decoders:

   2.  MUST reject any encoded major type 7 values other than false,
       true, null, and the floating point values.

2.7.  Strings

   CBOR [RFC8949] allows text strings to be any valid UTF-8 string
   (§3.1).  However, Unicode character sequences can represent the same
   text string in different ways, leading to variability in the encoding
   of semantically equivalent data items.  Unicode Normalization Form C
   (NFC) [UNICODE-NORM] is a commonly used normalization form that
   eliminates such variability.

   dCBOR encoders:

   1.  MUST only emit text strings that are in NFC.

   dCBOR decoders:

   1.  MUST reject any encoded text strings that are not in NFC.

3.  CDDL support, Declarative Tag

   CDDL [RFC8610] is a widely used language for specifying CBOR data
   models.  This specification adds two CDDL control operators that can
   be used to specify that the data items should be encoded in dCBOR.

   The control operators .dcbor and .dcborseq are exactly like .cbor and
   .cborseq as defined in [RFC8610] except that they also require the
   encoded data item(s) to conform to dCBOR.

   The CDDL Standard Prelude as defined in [RFC8610] Appendix D defines
   number = int / float.  This type encompass the full space of CBOR
   numeric values representable by CBOR major types 0, 1, and 7.
   Therefore dCBOR applications can use number to specify fields with
   numeric values, and dCBOR's Numeric Reduction ensures that these
   values are encoded deterministically.

   Tag 201 (Section 6) is defined in this specification as a way to
   declare its tag content to conform to dCBOR at the data model level
   and the encoded data item level.  (In conjunction with these
   semantics, tag 201 may also be employed as a boundary marker leading
   from an overall structure to specific application data items; see
   Section 3 of [GordianEnvelope] for an example for this usage.)

4.  Implementation Status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   (Boilerplate as per Section 2.1 of [RFC7942]:)

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

5.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits the security considerations of CBOR [RFC8949].

   Vulnerabilities regarding dCBOR will revolve around whether an
   attacker can find value in producing semantically equivalent
   documents that are nonetheless serialized into non-identical byte
   streams.  Such documents could be used to contain malicious payloads
   or exfiltrate sensitive data.  The ability to create such documents
   could indicate the failure of a dCBOR decoder to correctly validate
   according to this document, or the failure of the developer to
   properly specify or implement application protocol requirements using
   dCBOR.  Whether these possibilities present an identifiable attack
   surface is a question that developers should consider.

6.  IANA Considerations

8.  Appendix B: Design Principles

   This section is non-normative.

   dCBOR has a single overriding goal: to facilitate _determinism_.

   This means to ensure or facilitate, as much as possible, that
   semantically equivalent data items are encoded as identical byte
   streams.

   In general, this means reducing or eliminating _variability_ in the
   encoding of data items.  Variability arises where more than one valid
   encoding is possible for a given data item, and a protocol designer
   must make a choice as to which encoding to use.  These choices can be
   arbitrary, and different protocol designers may make different
   arbitrary, and equally valid choices.

   One of the most common examples of this arises with typed numeric
   values, where a numeric field must be pre-assigned a type (e.g.,
   signed or unsigned integer of 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, floating point
   of 16, 32, or 64 bits, etc.)  CBOR's basic numeric data model is
   typed, and requires that numeric values be encoded according to their
   type.  This is a cognitive burden on protocol designers, and a source
   of variability, since there may be several ways to encode a given
   numeric value depending on the type assigned to it.  Many developers
   would prefer to encode numeric values without worrying about types,
   and let the encoding format handle the details, including ensuring
   deterministic encoding.

   While dCBOR cannot automatically eliminate all variability in the
   design of deterministic protocols, it can provide a set of narrowing
   rules within its scope and level of abstraction that reduce the
   number of choices that protocol designers need to make.

   dCBOR makes no claim that these are the _only_ or _best_ possible
   narrowing rules for deterministic encoding for every application.
   But dCBOR does provide a set of well-defined, easy-to-understand, and
   easy-to-implement rules that can be deployed as a package to
   facilitate deterministic encoding for a wide variety of applications.
   Making these choices at the dCBOR level reduces cognitive burden for
   protocol designers, and decreases the risk of interoperability
   problems between different implementations.

   +-------------------------------------+----------------------------+

                                 Table 5

   The sections below explain the rationale for some of these choices.

8.1.  Why Numeric Reduction?

   The numeric model of [RFC8949] provides three kinds of basic numeric
   types: unsigned integers (Major Type 0), negative integers (Major
   Type 1), and floating point numbers (shares major Type 7 with Simple
   Values).  Not all applications require floating point values, and
   those that do not are unaffected by the presence of floating point
   numbers in the CBOR model.  However, the RFC introduces the
   possibility of variability in certain places.  For example, §3.4.2
   defines Tag 1 as "Epoch-Based Date/Time":

      Tag number 1 contains a numerical value counting the number of
      seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00Z in UTC time to the represented
      point in civil time.

      The tag content MUST be an unsigned or negative integer (major
      types 0 and 1) or a floating-point number (major type 7 with
      additional information 25, 26, or 27).  Other contained types are
      invalid.

   An inhabitant of Tag 1, as long as it represents an integral number
   of seconds since the epoch, could therefore be encoded as an integer
   _or_ the equivalent floating point number. dCBOR's Numeric Reduction
   rule ensures that such values are always encoded as integers,
   eliminating variability in the encoding of such values.

   But this raises a larger policy question for determinism: If two
   numeric values are semantically equal, should they be encoded
   identically? dCBOR answers "yes" to this question, and Numeric
   Reduction is the mechanism by which this is achieved.  This choice
   answers the determinism question in a way that is simple to
   understand and implement, and that works well for the vast majority
   of applications.  The serialization is still typed, but the burden of
   choosing types is reduced for protocol designers, who can simply
   specify numeric fields without worrying about the details of how
   those numbers will be encoded.

8.2.  Why Not undefined?

   How to represent an absent value is a perennial question in data
   modeling.  In general it is useful to have a value that represents a
   placeholder for a position where a value _could_ be present but is
   not.  This could be used in a map to indicate that a key is bound but
   has no value, or in an array to indicate that a value at a particular
   index is absent.  There are other sorts of absence as well, such as
   the absence of a key in a map, or a function that returns no value
   (void). dCBOR cannot by narrowing CBOR address all of these different
   notions of absence, but can and does address the lack of semantic
   clarity around the choice between null and undefined by choosing null
   as the sole representation of a placeholder for an absent value. null
   is widely used in data modeling, and has a clear and unambiguous
   meaning.  In contrast, undefined is less commonly used, and its
   meaning can be ambiguous.  By choosing null, dCBOR provides a single
   clear way to represent absent values, reducing variability.

8.3.  Why only a single NaN?

   How to represent the result of a computation like 1.0 / 0.0 is
   another perennial question in data modeling.  The [IEEE754] floating
   point standard answers this question with the concept of "Not a
   Number" (NaN): a special value that represents an unrepresentable or
   undefined numerical result.  However, the standard also specifies
   several bit fields within the NaN representation that can vary,
   including the sign bit, whether the NaN is "quiet" or "signaling",
   and a payload field.  These formations are useful in certain
   computational contexts, but have no generally-accepted meaning in
   data modeling.

   The problem of NaN is complicated by the fact that IEEE 754 specifies
   that all NaN values compare as "not equal" to all other numeric
   values, including themselves.  This means that comparing any two NaN
   values, including identical ones, will always yield "not equal".  The
   deeper problem this raises is that if you want to know what data a
   NaN might carry in its payload, you have to go to extraordinary
   lengths to extract that information, since you cannot simply compare
   two NaN values to determine whether they are the same.

   This not only raises deterministic variability issues (the array [1,
   NaN, 3] could be encoded in multiple ways depending on the NaN
   representation used), but also security issues as an attacker could
   use different NaN representations to exfiltrate data or hide
   malicious payloads, knowing that any comparison of NaN values will
   fail.

   Given that NaN has utility in general data modeling, but its
   specification complexities raise both determinism and security
   issues, dCBOR chooses to simplify the situation by requiring that all
   NaN values be encoded as the single quiet NaN value having the half-
   width CBOR representation 0xf97e00.

8.4.  Why not other simple values?

   [RFC8949] Major Type 7 defines a space of 256 code points for "simple
   values", and §3.3 defines four simple values and assigns them code
   points in the Major Type 7 space: false (20), true (21), null (22),
   and undefined (23).  We have already discussed the choice of null
   over undefined.  However, the remaining code points in this space are
   listed as either "unassigned" or "reserved" and delegates the
   registry of simple values to the IANA CBOR Simple Tags Registry
   [IANASIMPLEVALUES], which lists no assigned values other than those
   four.

   The implication of this is that the semantics of these other simple
   values are officially undefined, and they cannot simply be used as
   application-defined values without risking interoperability issues.
   dCBOR therefore chooses to limit use of simple values to the three
   well-defined values false, true, and null, which are widely used in
   data modeling and have clear and unambiguous meanings.

8.5.  Limiting Principles

   A limiting principle of dCBOR is that it concerns itself with the
   most common data items used in CBOR applications.  As a result, dCBOR
   does not place requirements on the encoding or decoding of CBOR data
   items that are less commonly used in practice, such as bignums,
   complex numbers, or other tagged data items. dCBOR implementations
   are not required to support these data items, but if they do, they
   must support them within the rules of dCBOR.

   Tags provide a useful "escape hatch" for applications that need to
   use data items not covered by dCBOR.  For example, dCBOR applications
   can freely use Tag 2 or Tag 3 to encode bignums, which contain byte
   strings, and on which dCBOR places no restrictions beyond those that
   apply to all byte strings (definite length only).  Similarly, the
   rare applications that need to convey nontrivial NaN values can use
   Tag 80, 81, or 82 as defined in the IANA CBOR Tags Registery
   [IANACBORTAGS].  These tags use byte strings to encode arrays of
   fixed-length IEEE 754 floating point values in big-endian byte order.

8.6.  Why not define an API?

   Because dCBOR mandates strictness in both encoding and decoding, and
   because of mechanisms it introduces such as Numeric Reduction, the
   question arises as to whether this document should specify an API, or
   at least a set of best practices, for dCBOR codec APIs.  The authors
   acknowledge that such guidance might be useful, but since the purpose
   of dCBOR is to provide a deterministic encoding format, and because
   APIs can vary widely between programming languages and environments,
   the authors have chosen to not widen the scope of this document.  We
   direct the reader to the several existing dCBOR implementations for
   guidance on API design.

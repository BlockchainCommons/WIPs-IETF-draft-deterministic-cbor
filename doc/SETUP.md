# Installation and Setup

At a minimum, you need `make` and `xml2rfc`.

Occasionally, you will want to [Update](#update) these tools.


## PATH

These instructions assume that you want to install to `~/.local/bin` and that
that directory is on `$PATH`.  You can replace this path with your preferred
binary location throughout.

To put this directory on your path, modify `~/.profile` as follows:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
$ echo 'export PATH="${PATH}:~/.local/bin"' >> ~/.profile
```

Note that most of these tools default to installing for all users, which you are
free to do, but a user-based install is easier to manage without invoking
`sudo` and the like.


## make

Mac users might need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to get a version of
[`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) that fully supports all of the template
features.  Apple ships an old version of GNU make with XCode which can fail in
mysterious ways.  Some effort has been made to avoid this bustage, so most
features work fine, but no warranty is made if something breaks.

```sh
brew install make
```

Note that this installs as `gmake`.  Follow the instructions to add this as
`make` to your path.

Windows users will need to use [Cygwin](http://cygwin.org/) or [the Windows
Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
to get `make`.


## xml2rfc

All systems require [xml2rfc](http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/).  This
requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).  Be sure not to get Python 2,
which is no longer supported.  The easiest way to get `xml2rfc` is with
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), which is either installed with
python, or part of the `python3-pip` (sometimes `python-pip`) package on most
distributions.

On some systems, you might need to install `pip` the hard way:

```sh
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
```

Once pip is installed, you can install xml2rfc.


```sh
$ pip3 install --user xml2rfc
```

xml2rfc might need development versions of [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/) and
[libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT).  These packages are named `libxml2-dev` and
`libxslt1-dev` (Debian, Ubuntu); `libxml2-devel` and `libxslt1-devel` (RedHat,
Fedora); `libxml2-devel` and `libxslt-devel` (Cygwin); or `libxml2` and
`libxslt` (Mac Homebrew).


## Archive-Repo

The archive-repo script is used by CI jobs and `make archive` to create an
archival copy of GitHub issues and pull requests.  It is not needed for most
local authoring.

If you need it, it can be installed with pip, as above.

```sh
$ pip3 install --user archive-repo
```


## Markdown

If you use markdown, you will also need to install `kramdown-rfc` or `mmark`.

The template stuff tries to work out which of these you are working with based
on the first line of the file:

* `kramdown-rfc` files must start with '---'

* `mmark` files must start with '%%%'

### kramdown-rfc

[`kramdown-rfc`](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc) requires
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and can be installed using the Ruby package
manager, `gem`:

```sh
$ gem install --user-install -N -n ~/.local/bin kramdown-rfc net-http-persistent
```

Note: Installing net-http-persistent makes this a lot faster.


### mmark

[`mmark`](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark) requires
[go](https://golang.org/), and that comes with its own complications.  This
assumes that you have Golang setup already.

```sh
$ go get github.com/mmarkdown/mmark
$ GOBIN=~/.local/bin go install github.com/mmarkdown/mmark
```

You might want to set aside a directory for your go code other than the default,
and find a directory that is on the path where you can install `mmark`.  For
these, I set `GOPATH=~/gocode`.


## Other tools

If you wish to build GitHub Pages, you will also need to install the Python packages
`pyyaml` (for kramdown-rfc Markdown) and/or `toml` (for mmark Markdown):

```sh
$ pip3 install --user toml pyyaml
```

Some other helpful tools are listed in `config.mk`.

# Update

Once you have these tools installed, it's worth updating occasionally.  Here's a
quick set of shortcuts for these tools.

```sh
$ pip3 install --user --upgrade xml2rfc archive-repo toml pyyaml
$ gem uninstall --user-install -n ~/.local/bin kramdown-rfc net-http-persistent
$ gem install --user-install -N -n ~/.local/bin kramdown-rfc net-http-persistent
$ go get -u github.com/mmarkdown/mmark@latest
$ GOBIN=~/.local/bin go install github.com/mmarkdown/mmark@latest
```
